## Setting up

1. Clone the repo and deploy it as a netlify (with one click via this DTN button)

<!-- Markdown snippet -->
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine)

2. Configure a Slack integration on your Slack account
3. Add the required environment variables for:
  - `API_AUTH`
  - `APPROVED_COMMENTS_FORM_ID`
  - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (You'll need to create and configure [a Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1))
4. **Add build hook** (`https://app.netlify.com/sites/{SITE_NAME}/settings/deploys#build-hooks`) which will rebuild and deploy the site whenever a new comment is submitted to the approved form
5. **Add a notification** (`https://app.netlify.com/sites/{SITE_NAME}/settings/forms#form-notifications`) which will call our build hook (above) when a new comment is added to the approved comments form.
6. **Add a notification** (`https://app.netlify.com/sites/{SITE_NAME}/settings/forms#form-notifications`) to call our comment handler lambda when a new comment is posted to the comments queue for approval.
